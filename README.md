## Overview

* Display Name: Display_Lib_RPI
* Author: Gavin Lyons.
* Description:

0. A C++ Library to connect for electronic displays to Raspberry Pi single board computers.
1. Dynamic install-able Raspberry Pi C++ library.
2. 12 fonts included, New Fonts can easily be added by user
3. Common Graphics + print class included
4. Low level Dependency: bcm2835 Library
5. 8 Displays supported at present, new components can be added.

* Development Tool chain.
	1. Raspberry PI 3 model b
	2. C++, g++ (Debian 12.2.0)
	3. Raspbian , Debian 12 bookworm OS, 64 bit.
	4. kernel : aarch64 Linux 6.1.0-rpi7-rpi-v8
	5. bcm2835 Library 1.74 dependency. Provides low level I2C bus, delays and GPIO control.

## Installation

TODO


## Test

1. Next step is to test your display and installed library with the included test example files.
2. Wire up your display.
3. Enter the example folder
4. Enter the appropriate category sub-folder for your type of display.
5. Edit the makefile in that folder to select the desired display and example file path.
		Simply edit "SRC" variable at top of the makefile. In the "User SRC directory Option Section" at top of file.
		Pick an example "SRC" directory path and One ONLY.
6. Run 'make' commmand. This makefile builds the examples file using the just installed library,
		and creates a test executable  file in "Bin".
7. Run 'make run' to run that built executable file. This wwraps "sudo" as the bcm2835 requires root permissions by default [see here for details](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/)
8. User should now see the test routine in that file running on the display. Run 'make help' to see other options.

```sh
cd examples
cd <display category name path>
make
make run
```

Display category name path tables:

| # | Display category name path | Display types |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| 1 | seven_segment_displays | LED modules |
| 2 | color16_displays| 16 bit graphic colour  |
| 3 | bicolor_displays| 2 colour Graphic |
| 4 | character_displays | character only LCD's |

### API Documentation

The API (application programming interface) documentation is at link below hosted on github pages and generated by Doxygen.

### Fonts

	The font system for the graphic displays readme is [here at link.](extra/doc/fonts/README.md)

## File system

There are a few  makefiles.

1. Root directory, builds and installs library at a system level.
2. Example directory, builds a chosen example file using installed library to an executable.
which can then be run. There is one makefile in each of the four categories of components
in example folder.

Library naming :

1. library name = librpidisplaygl
2. Linker flags for complier = -lrpidisplaygl (also needs -lbcm2835 for bcm2835 library)3
3. Library File suffix  = RDL
4. Project name = Display_Lib_RPI

## Notes and issues

1. Will not work on Raspberry 5 at present as the bcm2835 Library dependency is not updated
to work yet on Rpi5. Hopefully it will be updated soon , If it is not going to be updated, another path forward will be found.
